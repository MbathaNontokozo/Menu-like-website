Fast Food Yard is a simple beginner-friendly food restaurant project I created with the theme of a modern fast-food spot that serves burgers, pizzas, chicken meals, and chips. The goal was to design a clean and easy-to-understand layout that feels like a real restaurant menu and brand. While building Fast Food Yard, I learned the basics of structuring a website and organizing content into sections such as menu categories, descriptions, and prices. As a beginner, some challenges I faced included getting the layout to look neat, making sure the text and images lined up properly, and choosing colors and fonts that matched the fast-food theme. Through trial and error, I gained confidence in using HTML and CSS and understood the importance of planning before coding. This project gave me both practice and motivation to keep learning web development by building real-world ideas
